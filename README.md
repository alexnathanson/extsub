# Raspberry Pi External Subtitles

Displays subtitles on an external graphic LCD display synchronized to a video.

v0.2 (2016-06-06): omxplayer dbus time out problem identified as problem with omxplayer; this is fixed with recent updates. v.2 consolidates dbus calls in the Python script (eliminating the need for additional bash scripts)
v0.1 (2016-06-01): Synchornization works, but omxplayer dbus times out after 4 hours 38 minutes. No interface with the graphic LCD display yet.
